	<h3>Hello!</h3>
	<p class=about>Nice to see you and I'm glad that you found your way here. I'm have a
		M.Sc degree in mechanical engineering, but for some reason I like to code. I didn't have that much
		experience on programming when I went to the university and while I was busy
		studing mechanical engineering, I took one programming course: Introduction To Programming.
		It was basically an intro to Python. I didn't really shine in that course and I kind of hated programming back then.
		But during my studies I came to realize, that if I wanted to do scientific
		calculations, I had to know how to produce code. Because of my bad experience in the
		programming course, I figured that the only way I would learn is to read on my own and
		use google. After that, I've grown to like programming and now I do a lot of
		coding both at work and in leasure time projects.</p>

	<p class=about>When I started to read on my own I'd say my learning curve in programming
		has been more or less typical.	First python: basics of programming,
		learning list and string manipulations, functions, classes, etc. At that
		point I thought: "This is nice, programming is easy". Then I started to learn
		C++ and realized, that all was a lie.
		Compilers, templates, pointers, memory allocations... I triumphed and decided
		to try out C. It can't go any worse from here, right? But it was worth it.
		After that I've used f.ex. Java, Julia, JavaScript and tried out a dozen.</p>

	<p class=about>So what gives, why am I doing this blog now? I've used google as my daily tool
		to search for code snippets, error codes and examples for some
		time now. Usually it's quite easy to find code for programming related
		problems, but when it comes to find code how to implement some mathematical
		formula/algorithm/equation, that's a different story. Since it
		says in my CV, that I've studied mechanical engineering, not programming,
		I figured I could try to give my contribution
		by making posts in various analyses and implementations of some mathematical
		models.</p>
